## Details
The National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey (N-SUMHSS) replaced the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) and the National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS) in 2021 by combining questions for substance use and mental health facilities. The N-SSATS and N-MHSS were combined to reduce burden on the facilities, optimize government resources to collect data, and enhance the quality of data collected.

Prior to 2021, the objectives of the N-SSATS were to:

- Collect data that can be used to assist SAMHSA and state and local governments in assessing the nature and extent of the services provided and in forecasting treatment resource requirements,
- Analyze general treatment services trends, and
- Form the Inventory of Substance Use and Mental Health Treatment Facilities (I-TF).

### Where Do the Data Come From?
N-SSATS is an annual survey of all known public and private substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. N-SSATS collects three types of information from facilities:

The characteristics of individual facilities, including types of treatment provided and services offered, operation of the facility (public or private), and special programs or groups provided for specific client types. It also includes client outreach and payment options.
Client count information, which includes counts of clients served by service type and the number of beds designated for treatment.
General information, including licensure, certification, accreditation, and facility website availability.
