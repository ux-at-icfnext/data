Annually, the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) releases nationally representative data on key findings from drug-related emergency department visits. DAWN’s latest annual report includes data from drug-related ED visits in 2022, and is organized into the following sections:

1. Nationally representative weighted estimates, including percent and rates per 100,000, for all drug-related ED visits by age, sex, race, ethnicity, census region, and quarter
2. Nationally representative weighted estimates, including percent and rates per 100,000, for the top drugs involved in drug-related ED visits by age, sex, race, ethnicity, census region, and quarter
3. Nationally representative weighted estimates for different types of opioids involved in opioid-related ED visits
4. Nationally representative weighted estimates for drug-related ED visits involving more than one substance
5. Drugs that are new to DAWN’s drug vocabulary and classification system
