## Details
The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationwide public health surveillance system that captures data on emergency department (ED) visits related to recent substance use and misuse directly from the electronic health records of participating hospitals. The key objectives of DAWN are to:

- Monitor demographic and geographic distribution, and identify trends in substance-related ED visits;
- Provide timely data and serve as an early warning system that identifies emerging and novel psychoactive substances and/or combinations of substances; and
- Provide national estimates of substance

SAMHSA administered DAWN from 1992 through 2011 (legacy DAWN) and reestablished the current version of DAWN in 2018.

### Where do the Data come from
DAWN data are collected from a selection of non-federal, short-stay, general surgical, and medical hospitals with at least one ED open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and more than 100 visits per month. The recruitment of 53 hospitals was completed in 2021.
