title: National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)
subtitle: 2021 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) Releases
short:  |
  The data provide estimates of substance use and mental illness at the national, state, and substate levels. NSDUH data also help to identify the extent of substance use and mental illness among different subgroups, estimate trends over time, and determine the need for treatment services.

  - title: 1. How did the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continue to affect data collection for the 2021 NSDUH?
    content: |
      SAMHSA decided to continue with multimode data collection moving forward, meaning that the 2021 NSDUH is based on both in-person and web interviews. In-person data collection remained limited to areas with low COVID-19 infection rates. As COVID-19 infection rates dropped in most areas of the country over the course of the year, the proportion of web interviews decreased. More than three quarters of interviews in Quarter 1 were completed via the web (76.6 percent). By Quarter 4, fewer than half of the interviews (41.5 percent) were completed that way. Altogether, 54.6 percent of the 2021 interviews were completed via the web.
  - title: 2. Why is it not appropriate to compare estimates from 2021 with estimates from 2019 and earlier years?
    content: |
      In order to assess comparability, we first tested, “Did the mode of data collection (i.e. whether a respondent completed the survey on the web or in-person) influence the estimates?” In other words, “Were there differences between responses from the two modes of collection, and were those differences significant enough to affect whether or not the data from each mode was comparable?”
        - We found that estimates based on web interviews are different from estimates based on in-person interviews. First, we found that the demographics of each mode differed significantly. That is to say, the composition of the people answering by web differed from the composition of the people answering in-person (i.e. by gender, race, education, etc.). Secondly, in addition to demographic differences, we also found that in-person respondents were more likely to be users of certain substances and were more likely to have experienced mental health issues. These differences are often called a mode effect because the differences are observed between the two modes of data collection.
      
      We then asked, “Given that we know there are differences between modes of data collection which make them incomparable, can we use demographics to weight the data in such a way that they ARE comparable?” In other words, “Can we make both groups of respondents similar enough in demographic composition to control for the differences in mode that we observe, and therefore allow us to compare estimates between the two modes?”
        - We know that while weighting (adjusting) the data to account for the differing demographics between respondents who responded via the web and in person helps to lessen the mode effect impact, it doesn’t completely eliminate the effect enough so that we can fairly compare the two modes statistically. Because of this, estimates based on both web and in-person interviews are not comparable to estimates based on either mode alone.
        - Therefore, because 2021 estimates are based on multimode data collection and estimates from 2019 or earlier are based on in-person data collection alone, 2021 estimates are not comparable with estimates from 2019 or earlier. Estimates of change from 2019 or earlier to 2021 would be too greatly influenced by the mode effect.

Conducted annually, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) provides nationally representative data on the use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs; substance use disorders; receipt of substance use treatment; mental health issues; and the use of mental health services among the civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 12 or older in the United States. NSDUH estimates allow researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and the general public to better understand and improve the nation’s behavioral health. These reports and detailed tables present estimates from the 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Because of methodological changes in 2021, estimates from this year should not be compared with previous years.

**Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators in the United States**
NSDUH’s latest annual report shows indicators of substance use and mental health in the United States based on 2021 NSDUH data. Because of methodological changes in 2021, estimates from this year should not be compared with previous years. All reported indicators meet rigorous criteria for statistical precision. The [2021 Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators](/) report summarizes the following:

- Substance use (tobacco, alcohol, vaping, marijuana and other illicit drug use, as well as the use and misuse of prescription drugs)
- Initiation of substance use by type
- Substance use disorders (SUDs)
- Major depressive episode (MDE), any mental illness, and serious mental illness
- Mental illness and MDE co-occurring with substance use and SUDs
- Suicidal thoughts, plans, and non-fatal attempts
- Substance use treatment and mental health service use
- Perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use, mental health issues, and treatment

Estimates are presented by age group and by race/ethnicity for selected measures.

### Detailed Tables {. #tables}
The 2021 NSDUH Detailed Tables present national estimates of substance use and mental health. Because of methodological changes in 2021, estimates from this year should not be compared with previous years. The tables still include information for many different populations in 2021. They present indicators for youths aged 12 to 17 and adults aged 18 or older (separately or combined) on drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, risk and availability of substance use, substance initiation, substance use disorder (SUD), mental illness and major depressive episodes, suicidality, treatment, and the perceived effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, along with some other miscellaneous health topics. Please refer to the [Methodological Summary and Definitions](/) report for more information on the NSDUH survey.
