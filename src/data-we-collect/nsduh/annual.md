The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), conducted annually by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), provides nationally representative data on the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs; substance use disorders; receipt of substance use treatment; mental health issues; and the use of mental health services among the civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 12 or older in the United States. {: .usa-intro }

Currently, the annual national releases consist of three main products.

1. A National Report, which presents high-level and particularly notable information in an approachable format. It includes both text and graphs, along with basic explanations for the measures included.
2. A comprehensive set of detailed tables covering topics and demographic breakdowns beyond those covered in the National Report.
3. A Methodological Summary and Definitions report, which explains the way that the data was collected and the creation of the measures that are used in the other two products. The report also includes comparisons to other surveys for context.

Prior to 2017, there were multiple national topic reports, rather than the unified report that is currently released.

In some years there are other products, such as supplemental reports or presentations highlighting data on particular demographic groups.
