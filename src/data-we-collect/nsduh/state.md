title: National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)
subtitle: State Estimates
short:  |
  The data provide estimates of substance use and mental illness at the national, state, and substate levels. NSDUH data also help to identify the extent of substance use and mental illness among different subgroups, estimate trends over time, and determine the need for treatment services.

The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) releases state estimates for a limited number of substance use and mental health measures. They are generally based on two years of combined data and cover each state and the District of Columbia. {: .usa-intro }

Most state estimates are based on a small area estimation (SAE) methodology, in which state-level NSDUH data are combined with county and sub-county level census data from the state. **The Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimates Methodology Report** explains the methodological details.

You can find the latest available substate estimates in a number of formats: data tables, reports, and interactive maps. They are generally released every other year, although the 2018-2020 estimates are not available due to the impact of the Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on survey methodology.

### NSDUH Small Area Estimation Dataset for All Years
The **NSDUH Small Area Estimation Dataset** (SAS dataset) is a single file with each yearâ€™s small area estimates, associated confidence intervals, and other key statistics. It pulls together the data in the annually released State Result Data Tables into a single file for analysis by advanced users. It includes all estimates from 1999 to the present.

#### NSDUH Small Area Estimation Dataset [1999-2019](/)

The [dataset documentation](/) provides information about the file, including a description of the variables.

### State Result Data Tables
The **NSDUH State Result Data Tables** provide statistics on select substance use and mental health outcomes by state and age group. Accompanying **P-Value Tables** let you see if the differences between states are statistically significant, or if changes over time are statistically significant.

### Interactive NSDUH State Estimates
The [**Interactive NSDUH State Estimates**](/) is an online data tool that displays the prevalence of mental health or substance use issues within different geographic areas using model-based estimates. Use this tool to compare between areas, look at how the outcome has changed over time, or compare the data to related issues.

### State Result Maps of Prevalence Estimates
The **NSDUH National Maps of Prevalence Estimates** display the state estimates from the **NSDUH State Result Data Tables** in the form of colored maps of the United States overall and by age group.

### Behavioral Health Barometer Reports
The [**Behavioral Health Barometer**](/) reports provide estimates on mental health, substance use, and associated treatment using NSDUH data for each state,HHS region, and the United States. They are not based on the small area estimation methodology.

### Other Sources of State-Level Data
The **Other Sources of State-Level Data** report briefly describes the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and compares BRFSS and NSDUH state estimates for alcohol and cigarette use.
