title: National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)
subtitle: State Data Tables and Reports From the 2021 NSDUH
short:  |
  The data provide estimates of substance use and mental illness at the national, state, and substate levels. NSDUH data also help to identify the extent of substance use and mental illness among different subgroups, estimate trends over time, and determine the need for treatment services.

  - title: 1. How did the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continue to affect data collection for the 2021 NSDUH?
    content: |
      SAMHSA decided to continue with multimode data collection moving forward, meaning that the 2021 NSDUH is based on both in-person and web interviews. In-person data collection remained limited to areas with low COVID-19 infection rates. As COVID-19 infection rates dropped in most areas of the country over the course of the year, the proportion of web interviews decreased. More than three quarters of interviews in Quarter 1 were completed via the web (76.6 percent). By Quarter 4, fewer than half of the interviews (41.5 percent) were completed that way. Altogether, 54.6 percent of the 2021 interviews were completed via the web.
  - title: 2. Why is it not appropriate to compare estimates from 2021 with estimates from 2019 and earlier years?
    content: |
      In order to assess comparability, we first tested, “Did the mode of data collection (i.e. whether a respondent completed the survey on the web or in-person) influence the estimates?” In other words, “Were there differences between responses from the two modes of collection, and were those differences significant enough to affect whether or not the data from each mode was comparable?”
        - We found that estimates based on web interviews are different from estimates based on in-person interviews. First, we found that the demographics of each mode differed significantly. That is to say, the composition of the people answering by web differed from the composition of the people answering in-person (i.e. by gender, race, education, etc.). Secondly, in addition to demographic differences, we also found that in-person respondents were more likely to be users of certain substances and were more likely to have experienced mental health issues. These differences are often called a mode effect because the differences are observed between the two modes of data collection.
      
      We then asked, “Given that we know there are differences between modes of data collection which make them incomparable, can we use demographics to weight the data in such a way that they ARE comparable?” In other words, “Can we make both groups of respondents similar enough in demographic composition to control for the differences in mode that we observe, and therefore allow us to compare estimates between the two modes?”
        - We know that while weighting (adjusting) the data to account for the differing demographics between respondents who responded via the web and in person helps to lessen the mode effect impact, it doesn’t completely eliminate the effect enough so that we can fairly compare the two modes statistically. Because of this, estimates based on both web and in-person interviews are not comparable to estimates based on either mode alone.
        - Therefore, because 2021 estimates are based on multimode data collection and estimates from 2019 or earlier are based on in-person data collection alone, 2021 estimates are not comparable with estimates from 2019 or earlier. Estimates of change from 2019 or earlier to 2021 would be too greatly influenced by the mode effect.

Find reports for U.S. states based on small area estimation of the 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). NSDUH state estimates are typically based on two years of combined data. However, these preliminary estimates are based on a single year of data, produced because changes to survey methodology in 2021 mean the data cannot be combined with previous years. Two year estimates that combine 2021 and 2022 will be available after the 2022 data release. **Because 2021 state estimates are based on a single year of data, there is greater variance around the estimates than for the usual two-year estimates, particularly in small states and for uncommon outcomes.**

### NSDUH State Result Data Tables
The 2021 NSDUH state data tables provide estimates for 35 measures of substance use and mental health by age group. Due to methodology changes, they cannot be compared to previous years’ estimates. The estimates are based on a small area estimation (SAE) methodology, in which state-level NSDUH survey data of the civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 12 or older are combined with local census data. The age groups available are 12 or older, 12 to 17, 18 or older, 18 to 25, and 26 or older, as well as 12 to 20 for some alcohol measures

The 2021 NSDUH State Prevalence Estimates provide prevalence (percentage) estimates and 95% confidence intervals by age group.

The 2021 NSDUH Estimated Totals By State provide the estimated population totals and 95% confidence intervals by age group.

Accompanying p-value tables are also available to help users determine if differences between geographies are statistically significant. There is also a [guide to their use](/).

### NSDUH State Result Maps
The 2021 NSDUH National Maps of Prevalence Estimates by State show the 2021 estimates with states sorted into five categories based on the value of the estimate and colored accordingly.

A report on the categories for each measure is also available.

### Interactive State Estimates - Coming Soon
The [Interactive NSDUH State Estimates](/) is an online data tool that displays the prevalence data in a user-friendly format. Use this tool to compare between areas, look at older estimates, or compare the data for related issues.

### State and Regional Methodology Reports
The 2021 NSDUH: Guide to State Tables and Summary of Small Area Estimation Methodology Report is a guide to the development and presentation of the 2021 state estimates. A summary of the methodology is included, as well as sample sizes, response rates, and population estimates.

The 2021 NSDUH: Other Sources of State-Level Data report provides a brief description of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and compares state-level BRFSS and NSDUH prevalence estimates for alcohol and cigarette use among people aged 18 or older.
